<p><b>Isn't the consumption of meat bad for me?</b></p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px">Eating meat in moderation as part of a balanced diet can provide important nutrients such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12. While excessive consumption of red and processed meat has been linked to certain health risks, incorporating lean cuts of meat into a healthy diet can be beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Isn't the consumption of meat bad for the environment?</b></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 20px">While some types of meat production can have negative environmental impacts, not all meat production is created equal. Sustainable and regenerative farming practices can actually benefit the environment by improving soil health and sequestering carbon. Additionally, grazing animals can help to maintain grasslands and other ecosystems. And of course, buying local Scottish meat ensure transport carbon footprint is as low as possible</p>

<p><b>Why is it  important to source Scottish meat?</b></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 20px">Sourcing Scottish meat supports the rural economy and helps to preserve traditional farming practices. Scotland's unique landscape and climate provide ideal conditions for producing high-quality meat with exceptional flavor. Scottish meat is also subject to strict quality control measures, ensuring a premium product for consumers</p>
